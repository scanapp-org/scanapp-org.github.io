QR codes have become a ubiquitous sight in recent years. From advertisements and magazines to public transport and billboards, these 2D barcodes can be found just about everywhere.

## What is a QR code?

A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that can store a large amount of information. QR codes were first developed in 1994 by a subsidiary of Toyota, Denso Wave. Originally intended for use in the automotive industry, QR codes have since become popular in advertising and marketing, as well as in other industries. QR codes can be scanned using a smartphone camera or a webcam, as long as the device has the appropriate software installed.

## How do webcams scan QR codes?

Webcams can scan QR codes using software that recognizes and interprets the code. The software is called a QR code reader or scanner. There are many QR code reader apps available for smartphones, but not all webcams come equipped with the software necessary to read QR codes. For those that do, the software is often built into the webcam's driver or included in the operating system.

Once the QR code reader software is installed, all you need to do is hold the QR code up to the webcam, and the software will do the rest. The webcam will capture an image of the QR code, and the software will decode the information contained within the code. This information could be a website URL, a phone number, an email address, or any other type of data.
