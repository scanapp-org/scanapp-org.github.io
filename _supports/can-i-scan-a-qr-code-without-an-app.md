QR codes have become a popular way to quickly access information, such as website URLs, contact information, and product details. Many people wonder if they can scan a QR code without downloading an app.

In this article, we will explore the answer to this question, and use scanapp.org as an example.

## Can I scan a QR code without an app?

The short answer is yes, you can scan a QR code without downloading an app. However, the method you use will depend on the device you are using and the operating system it runs on.

If you are using an iPhone or iPad, you can use the built-in camera app to scan QR codes. Simply open the camera app and point it at the QR code. The camera will automatically recognize the code and display a notification. Tap on the notification to access the information.

If you are using an Android device, the process is a little more complicated. Some Android devices may have a built-in QR code scanner in the camera app, but not all do. If your device does not have a built-in scanner, you can use a third-party app to scan QR codes. There are many free apps available on the Google Play Store that you can download and use.
